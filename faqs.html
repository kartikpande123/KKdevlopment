                        Your Web browser may have a “do not track” setting which, when enabled, causes your browser to

                        not
                        track HTTP header file or “signal” to each site you visit. At present, the Offerings do not
                        respond to
                        this
                        type

                        personal
                        information
                        upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is
                        inaccurate or to
                        delete
                        such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for
                        legitimate
                        business purposes. You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your information at
                        any
                        time.
                        To do
                        so, please contact us at legal@trootech.com with your name and email ID and the information
                        requested to
                        be
                        accessed, corrected or removed. If you are using the Service (any of our product demo), log in
                        to your
                        account,
                        go to Your Account Settings, and make the desired changes. We may decline to process requests
                        that are
                        unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance,
                        requests
                        concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, would be
                        extremely
                        impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide
                        information
                        access
                        and
                        correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a
                        disproportionate
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>Please note that if you cease using the Service or we terminate your access to the Service in
                        accordance
                        with
                        your Terms Of Website Use, you may no longer have the ability to access or request to update
                        your
                        information.</p>
                    <p>We may retain your information as necessary to support the Offerings, comply with our legal
                        obligations
                        or
                        resolve disputes. Note that content you post on our Offerings may remain on the Offerings even
                        if you

                        using the Offerings or we terminate your access to the Offerings.
